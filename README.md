This is a project for the Nand2tetris part -2 course in Coursera. (Course Link - https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2 )

Here, I built a full-fledged compiler for a java-like programming language called *JACK language* using java program.
Nested classed are used for different stages of compilation.

It converts any high level Jack program to an intermediate VM code, like *javac* bytecode.

Translator is to be run in command line.

Code is bit messy but it works.
